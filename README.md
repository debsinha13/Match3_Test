This project is designed to implement the core mechanics of a Match3 game.

Implemented Features:
Swap Animations: Developed smooth animations for both valid and invalid moves during symbol swaps.
Match Animations and VFX: Integrated visual effects and animations to highlight matched symbols.
Cascading Animations: Created sequential animations for the cascading of symbols after matches occur.

Technical Implementation:
Animations were achieved through a combination of scripts, particle effects, animations, and shaders.
For script-driven animations, Unity Coroutines and the DoTween library were utilized.

Development Process:
I started with base code from an older Udemy tutorial on match games and significantly refactored it to meet my specific requirements, focusing on structure improvements, animation enhancements, and performance optimization.
